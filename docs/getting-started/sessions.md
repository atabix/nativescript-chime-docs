## What is a session?

A session The root object of the Amazon Chime SDK for JavaScript that represents each userâ€™s session in a meeting. The web applications start by instantiating MeetingSession and configuring it with the correct meeting and attendee information. You can think of it as a conference room. In order to create one we need to call the class method [create](/docs/api/chime-session/#create)

## Creating a session
now that we now what a session is we need two things in order to create it:

[**meeting**](/docs/api/interfaces/#chimemeetingoptions)  
`An ephemeral resource identified by a unique MeetingId. The MeetingId is placed onto a group of media services that host the active meeting.`

[**attendee**](/docs/api/interfaces/#chimeattendeeoptions)  
`A meeting participant that is identified by a unique AttendeeId. Attendees may freely join and leave meetings using a client application built with an Amazon Chime SDK client library.`
  

We can after call the create method and we now have a session.
  
```js
const meetingSession = ChimeSession.create(meeting, attendee);
```
